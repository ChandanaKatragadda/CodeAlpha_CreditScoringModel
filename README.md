# CodeAlpha_CreditScoringModel# 💳 Credit Scoring Model – CodeAlpha Internship

This project is part of the Machine Learning Internship at **CodeAlpha**.  
The objective is to predict whether an individual is creditworthy based on financial and demographic features using classification models.

---

## 📌 Project Objective

The aim is to develop a machine learning model that can assess a person's creditworthiness. This is especially useful in the banking and finance sector where such models help reduce financial risk and improve lending decisions.

---

## 📂 Dataset Overview

The dataset includes various features such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Income
- Employment status
- Loan amount
- Existing debts
- Credit history
- Payment defaults (target label)

---

## 🧼 Data Preprocessing

- Handled missing values
- Encoded categorical variables
- Normalized numerical features
- Split into training and test datasets (typically 80/20 split)

---

## 🧠 Machine Learning Models Used

- Logistic Regression
- Decision Tree Classifier
- Random Forest Classifier ✅ *(Best performer)*

---

## 📈 Model Evaluation

Metrics used to evaluate performance:

- Accuracy
- Confusion Matrix
- Precision & Recall
- F1-Score
- ROC-AUC Score

> Final model accuracy: **XX%**

---

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Feature engineering from financial data
- Comparing multiple classification algorithms
- Evaluating imbalanced data models with appropriate metrics
- Model tuning using cross-validation
